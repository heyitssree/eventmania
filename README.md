# 🚀 EventMania: The Agentic Event Marketplace

---

## 🏛️ 1. Executive Summary & Philosophy
**EventMind** is a next-generation marketplace platform that leverages **Autonomous AI Agents** to automate the entire event management lifecycle—from event creation and marketing to attendee networking and ticketing.

By shifting from a passive tool to an **agentic ecosystem**, EventMind provides organizers with a "zero-touch" backend and attendees with a hyper-personalized discovery experience.

| **Discovery** | Attendees find events based on their **AI-Generated Interest Mosaics**, not just keywords. |
| **Monetization** | Instant, secure checkout via **Stripe** with automated organizer split-payments. |
| **Networking** | **Shadow Bonding Agents** match attendees with similar profiles in the Chat communities. |
| **Analytics** | Deep-dive insights into demand, sentiment, and attendee engagement. |

## 🚀 4. Getting Started (Shadow Mode)
We've built a custom **One-Click Bootstrap** to bypass Docker/Kafka requirements for immediate testing:

> **Requirements:** Python 3.11+ (tested on 3.13 64-bit), Flutter SDK installed.
> **Python version note:** Originally developed on Python 3.11/3.12. Dependency versions have been updated to support Python 3.13. Do NOT use 32-bit Python.
> **Windows Note:** Run this once to allow activation scripts:
> `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

1.  **Create & activate a virtual environment** (once only):
    ```powershell
    py -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** (once only, with venv active):
    ```powershell
    py backend/scripts/install_all.py
    ```

3.  **Launch Backend** — Terminal 1 (activate venv first):
    ```powershell
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    py backend/scripts/shadow_runner.py
    ```

4.  **Launch Frontend** — Terminal 2:
    ```powershell
    cd frontend
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```
